#Working with strings
#In this program, we will see how to use strings. 
name= input("What is your name? ");
age= input("What is your age? ");
print('Hi '+ name + ', You are ' + age + ' years old')
#String formatting is used which is another way to print strings. Both serve the same purpose
print(f'Hi {name}, You are {age} years old');
#Console :
#What is your name? Rekhi
#What is your age? 50
#Hi Rekhi, You are 50 years old
#Hi Rekhi, You are 50 years old
